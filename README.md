# MidJourney x discord.py x Next.js

This repository is a practical implementation of discord.py and Next.js technologies, aimed at streamlining the process
of viewing the upscaled images from Midjourney.

## Overview

1. [**Discord Bot**](https://github.com/Friedemann12/disJourney/tree/main/discordBot): Python Discord Bot, utilizing the
   discord.py library, this bot is designed to fetch all the upscaled images of Midjourney from designated Discord
   channels.

2. [**Next.js Diashow**](https://github.com/Friedemann12/disJourney/tree/main/diashow): A web application built with
   Next.js, which displays the images fetched by the Discord bot in a slideshow format.

## Purpose

This project's aim is to provide a simple and direct way to view Midjourney's upscaled images. The Discord bot fetches
these images from various channels, while the Next.js application displays them in a slideshow.

## Exploring the Repository

If you're interested in understanding how to build a Discord bot using discord.py or want to learn more about creating
web applications with Next.js, this repository could serve as a practical example. It demonstrates how these
technologies can work together to automate and display a collection of images.
